# Part 10 - React Native

## About React Native

Mark Zuckerburg once said that a big mistake that Facebook made was to develop web apps for mobile that ran in an embedded browser window. However, these applications aren't very performant and can't nail the look-and-feel of a native application.

React Native is a framework for developing native Android and iOS applications using JavaScript and React. It provides a set of cross-platform components that utilize the platform's native components behind the scenes. You get all of the familiar features of React such as JSX, components, props, state, and hooks in a native application. Many libraries, such as react-redux, react-apollo, react-router, etc. are able to be used.

The best benefit of React Native is the speed of development and gentle learning curve.
